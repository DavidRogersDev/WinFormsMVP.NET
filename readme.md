# WinFormsMVP.NET  

A simple Model View Presenter framework for the Winforms platform.    

**WinFormsMVP.NET** is a port of my previous framework, [WinFormsMVP](https://github.com/DavidRogersDev/WinformsMVP), to the new .NET platform (.NET 5).    

This [CodeProject article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/522809/WinForms-MVP-An-MVP-Framework-for-WinForms) is still valid in terms of setting out the basics.  In addition to that, there are several samples in the [samples directory](https://github.com/DavidRogersDev/WinFormsMVP.NET/tree/main/samples) of the repository, which show how the library can be used.    
  
I also hope to make a few videos in the near future which explain a few features, including the fundamentals (watch this space).   
  
## Why? 
Back in 2012, I was deployed on a maintenance gig with lots of small WinForms apps which comprised a larger system. None of the existing apps followed any kind of best practice. It was all code-behind, with business logic mixed in with the View.   
  
A light weight MVP framework would have been perfect for these small apps. Something like the excellent Web Forms MVP, but for WinForms. And hence my decision to create such a framework.  
 
WinFormsMVP.NET is also great for students of design patterns. People who are learning how to code to patterns. It is a simple framework, so learners will not be overwhelmed by a plethora of features which would detract from their core purpose of learning about how the MVP design pattern works.  
  
## Feature Complete
You won't see much work going into this project, as it is feature complete. If others want to add features, fork away. If a passionate dev wants to take over stewardship of this little framework, by all means get in contact. Whilst I was happy to bring it to the new platform, I have moved on and don't really give it the love it deserves.
